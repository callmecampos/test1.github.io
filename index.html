    <h1>About Felipe</h1>
    <p>Felipe is a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, where he
      spends his time doing cool projects that range from engineering smart mattresses
      to visualizing revolutionary genome editing technology in augmented reality.
      He also enjoys hanging out with his friends, making a concerted effort to
      yell at them about space, time, the nature of reality, and why political
      correctness is a stepping stone to the downfall of our democracy. Most days he tries to read
      but ends up interchangibly scrolling through Reddit (memes), Instagram (memes), and
      Twitter (watching people argue...also memes). He then criticizes his fellow
      teenagers for ubiquitously spending 95% or more of their time engrossed in
      an abstract, jealousy-and-anxiety-filled bubble when they could be spending
      their time reading a book or going outside. Felipe also sometimes studies
      and does his homework.</p>

    <p>Felipe's favorite artits include Anderson .Paak, The Internet, BJ The Chicago Kid,
    and Mos Def. He also loves San Francisco and the Bay, but misses his family in Brazil and
    on the East Coast from time to time.</p>
